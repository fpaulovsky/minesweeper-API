# minesweeper-API

This is a MineSweeper ASP.NET Core Web API project.

# Setup
It persists games data in an SQL Server database. You just need to change the connection strings in the appsettings.json file. Open it, and replace &lt;here you put your user&gt; by your DB user ID and &lt;here you put your password&gt; by your password.

# Running the API
Open the project with VS2019, build it and run it by clicking the play button. A browser will be open showing Swagger (Open API). There you'll be able to play with the API.
