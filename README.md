# minesweeper-API

This is a MineSweeper ASP.NET Core Web API project.

It persists games data in an SQL Server database. You just need to change the connection strings in the appsettings.json file. Open it, and replace "<here you put your user>" by your DB user ID and "<here you put your password>" by your password.
